**Image content** 

We need image content that's royalty free and high quality. Find images roughly the same size/dimension as the current, found in `assets/img/porfolio`.

These will obviously be replaced with real/updated content onces the site is revealed at xmas! For now we'll setup with stock photos and our text content underneath general things I know he's done. 

1. Enterprise Maintenance - Local housing authority
		* image of nicely manicured large apartment complex
2. Historic Barn Renovation
		* image of a beautiful old barn
3. Residential Landscape
		* image of a nice looking house with good landscaping
		* might be enough just to search landscaping alone
4. Snow removal

		* I'm iffy on this as a concept since these are 'portfolio pieces'
5. Interior Remodel - commercial
